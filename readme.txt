Gives you complete freedom with how you display the price of your WooCommerce variable products. Replace the price range with the lowest price.

== Description ==

**Better Variation Price for WooCommerce** allows you to replace the default price range with either the lowest or highest price. You can completely customize the text displayed for the default price.

Here are the options:
* **Display type:** Choose to display the default price range, the lowest price, or the highest price
* **Display format:** This gives you total control on how the price should be displayed. By default, the price will look like this: **From: $ 9.90**
* **Update on variation change:** Update the main price with the selected variation's price, instead of displaying a barely visible price somewhere below the description
* **Hide Reset Variations Link:** Remove the *clear* link that appears when you select a variation
